                                GE2: General education courses have helped me think about my relationship with the public as an engineer. I've learned to be more cognizant about how my
                                work impacts other, and whether engineering is even the best route to tackle a problem. Gen eds have also inspired me to make things that have a connection
                                to people and improve their lives. As far as formulating solutions, gen ed courses have given me new frames of reference to help me think outside the box..

                                whatever I make shouldn't exploit or hurt people, and should instead improve their quality of life.
