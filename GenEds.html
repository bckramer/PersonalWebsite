                                GE2: General education courses have helped me think about my relationship with the public as an engineer. I've learned to be more cognizant about how my
                                work impacts other, and whether engineering is even the best route to tackle a problem. Gen eds have also inspired me to make things that have a connection
                                to people and improve their lives. As far as formulating solutions, gen ed courses have given me new frames of reference to help me think outside the box..

                                ISU has prepared me for a lot of things, and I consider my time here to have been
                                incredibly valuable. This report will cover these aspects in detail, and include a summary of
                                many different aspects of being an engineer at Iowa State.

                                At ISU, I have also become more effective in groups thanks to in-depth group courses
                                like SE 491 and COM S 309. I've also had plenty of classes that incorporated valuable group
                                project into the curriculum. However, I have had little exposure to classes that highlight
                                contemporary issues in engineering. This would have been valuable in helping me see where
                                my skills could be applied. That being said, I do feel I am equipped with an understanding of
                                professional and ethical duties
                            </p>

                                When doing projects in my ISU courses, I used a variety of resources. Perhaps most
                                importantly was StackOverflow. That website provides tons of answers from the most simple to
                                the most complex. I have also learned a ton from working with other students, and in return,
                                have helped impart what I've learned onto other students.

                                As an executive member of the Game Development Club, I have become a much more
                                effective and comfortable presenter, organizer, and leader. Interacting with underclassmen and
                                giving them the resources they need to be successful in something they care about has been a
                                tremendously rewarding experience. This in turn has made me a better group partner and more
                                organized student.

                                To keep myself sharp and further explore personal interests, I have undertaken game
                                development as my primary hobby. In the process, I have become a better programmer, while
                                picking up non-engineering related skills like visual art and music production. This has made me
                                more comfortable with taking on new, unknown problems.

                                If I were an undergrad, I believe my life would be a lot more organized than it was as a
                                freshman! I also believe I would work in a more effective way and come up with not only a
                                correct solution, but a sophisticated one as well. Growing as an engineer to me means learning
                                how to make things, and make them the right way. If I were an undergrad again, I would slow
                                down and come up with a solution that solves the problem and makes the most sense.

                                I chose to write about the case study involving Theranos. If I was a developer of this
                                company, I would like to believe I would have left before it became known that the product was
                                'vaporware.' More so, I would like to believe I would have tried to expose the lies of the
                                company. However, the latter action is tricky. The case study makes it seem as if whistleblowers
                                were hit with harsh legal action, which helps squash any attempts to show the company for what
                                it really is.

                                I believe the engineers did what they did because attempts to expose the company
                                would have likely entailed legal action, and furthermore, if the engineers ever did figure out how
                                to make the product Holmes claims she could the wave of fame and fortune would have been
                                immense. This creates string negative and positive incentive to stick with the company and ride
                                it out as long as you can.
