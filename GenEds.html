                            <p class="card-text">This was a final project for COM S 336: Introduction to Computer Graphics. As a team, another student and I created a simple particle system using
                            WebGL and Three.js. The version that you can try below uses 3000 particles that spread out over a period of time, despawn then spawn again. Using the various customizations,
                                many different effects and styles can be made.
                            </p>
                            <p>While challenging, this project was a ton of fun to make and taught me a lot about computer graphics. We began by naively spawning thousands of objects, only to
                            realize just how slow that would really be. Eventually, we learned how to maximize efficiency by using simple vertices and buffer attributes.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Myrtle is a project a team of two students and I did for the 2017 Fall Hackathon at Iowa State. We built a simple game, a genetic algorithm and a
                                neural network in Java in about thirty hours named Myrtl. The program would play the game, at first trying random actions, and then through genetic mutations and neural network modifications, learn how to play
                                the game. It was my first foray into the world of AI and one of the most challenging projects I've ever done. The team and I learned a ton about neural networks, machine learning and AI.

                            <p class="card-text">
                                I was in charge of the construction of the neural network, which was built from scratch in Java. No libraries were used, which meant I had to have a concrete grasp of the network
                                and what requirements it had to have if I was going to be successful. There were many times in which it was very difficult to conceptualize and visualize the network, but through perseverance I
                                came out successful. I also lent my hand in debugging and tweaking the genetic algorithm, which takes several network and selects the best traits to be passed onto a new generation.
