            <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px">Starting in the spring of 2017, I began working for the Iowa State University IT department as a student software developer. This meant contributing to the development
                of a web application as a full-stack programmer. I worked alongside full time developers, participating in daily stand-ups centered around the progress of the application. Through this experience I gained valuable
                teamwork and communication skills.
            <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px">As a full stack developer, I quickly picked up skills pertaining to all ends of the project. Before being hired, the only language I had real ability in was Java, but by the end of this past summer
                I had gained skills with JQuery, SQL, HTML and CSS, RESTful API development and the Spring Framework. All this while taking my Java ability to a new level. Learning new things is a major strength of mine and thanks to this
                experience, my learning confidence has skyrocketed. When given a task using tools I'm not familiar with, I know I can come up with a solution.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px">While working in a team, I learned many useful tools of development. Everybody on the team has a responsibility to review pull requests and projects are done using Agile
                based values. The specific tools we use for team collaboration include BitBucket, JIRA, Git and Confluence. As a student, I have continued working with the university which allows me to apply what I learn in the classroom to what I do at work. It's a chance to see both the academic
                and real world uses of coding.
