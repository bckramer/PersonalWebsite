            <p class="paragraph"><strong>John Deere</strong></p>
            <p class="paragraph">During the summer of 2018, I interned with John Deere as an IT intern, working from their Intelligent Solutions Group division. This was an exciting opportunity to get familiar with
            large scale, enterprise applications.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">While at John Deere, I worked with their teams in India to add functionality to one of their most important web applications. The project I worked on helped add
            convenience and value to 70% of the application users. To accomplish this task, I worked closely with another intern whom I pair programmed with nearly every day. We also
            utilized the talent around us by asking for help and advice from full time developers, including those in India.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">To keep development organized, I also used Agile practices, including pair programming, daily stand ups, retrospectives and test driven development. John Deere
            as a company heavily relies on these practices, so it was a great place to truly understand the Agile methodology. It also helped me push my communication skills, as over communication
            was always preferred.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Working with John Deere turned me from a good communicator and Java programmer to a great one. I learned valuable networking skills at several
            John Deere events and pushed myself to ask for help when I needed it. My Java capabilities were also tested at John Deere, I've never felt better with the language.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"><strong>Iowa State University IT</strong></p>
            <p class="paragraph">Starting in the spring of 2017, I began working for the Iowa State University IT department as a student software developer. This meant contributing to the development
                of a web application as a full-stack programmer. I worked alongside full time developers, participating in daily stand-ups centered around the progress of the application. Through this experience I gained valuable
                teamwork and communication skills.
            <p class="paragraph">As a full stack developer, I quickly picked up skills pertaining to all ends of the project. Before being hired, the only language I had real ability in was Java, but by the end of this past summer
                I had gained skills with JQuery, SQL, HTML and CSS, RESTful API development and the Spring Framework. All this while taking my Java ability to a new level. Learning new things is a major strength of mine and thanks to this
                experience, my learning confidence has skyrocketed. When given a task using tools I'm not familiar with, I know I can come up with a solution.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">While working in a team, I learned many useful tools of development. Everybody on the team has a responsibility to review pull requests and projects are done using Agile
                based values. The specific tools we use for team collaboration include BitBucket, JIRA, Git and Confluence. As a student, I have continued working with the university which allows me to apply what I learn in the classroom to what I do at work. It's a chance to see both the academic
                and real world uses of coding.
