         <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px">My name is Benjamin Kramer and I am a software engineering student at Iowa State University, currently in my junior year. My passion for technology stems from
             a love of video games that I've had since I was young. As I grew older, I identified software development as being what I wanted to do as a career. However, it hasn't been that straightforward.
             Since starting college, I've realized the scope and application of software is vast, and I'm dedicated to learning as much about it as I can. This has lead me to learning about all sorts of
             different software applications. From computer vision to user experience programming, I've found there's always something interesting around the corner. This website will give you a good
             idea of my strengths, weaknesses, interests and accomplishments, while also exemplifying my knowledge of web development. If you still want to learn more, feel free
             to connect with me on LinkedIn and visit my GitHub page! If you need a developer and are interested in hiring me, contact me at bckramer@iastate.edu!
