         <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px">My name is Benjamin Kramer and I am a software engineering student and developer at Iowa State University. My passion for technology began
             about the time I first played Star Fox on the Nintendo 64. From then on, I became fascinated with how games worked, and eventually how software as a whole worked. Once I dug my teeth
             into coding in high school, I realized how expansive and powerful software was. From then on, it was clear I had to pursue a career in the field.
         </p>
         <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px">To get a head start on this pursuit, I started playing around with C# and the Unity game engine in high school. While the best I could come up with at the time was a text adventure game and a
             3D marble rolling game, it gave me a great foundation for coding. Basic concepts were easier to relearn when I took my first coding class my senior year of high school. Here I picked up skills
             in Python. The assignments we were given were my first experiences with difficult coding challenges. By the time I was in college, all my basic skills were solidified, giving me a chance to sharpen them
             even further in my introductory courses.
         </p>
         <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px">By the spring of my freshman year, I was fortunate enough to be hired as a student developer at Iowa State.
             Over the summer, this meant forty hour work weeks of constant challenges, which made for great advancement in my coding ability.
         </p>
         <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px">More recently, my passion led me to my first hackathon, hosted at Iowa State University. Here I developed my first neural network with a team of two other students.
             Since then, I've found myself thinking about artificial intelligence and its uses more frequently. In the future, I'd love to work on more AI focused projects.
