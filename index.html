                <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px">My name is Benjamin Kramer and I am a software engineering student and developer at Iowa State University. My passion for technology began
                    about the time I first played Star Fox on the Nintendo 64. From then on, I became fascinated with how games worked, and eventually how software as a whole worked. Once I dug my teeth
                    into coding in high school, I realized how expansive and powerful software was. From then on, it was clear I had to pursue a career in the field.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px">To get a head start on this pursuit, I started playing around with C# and the Unity game engine in high school. While the best I could come up with at the time was a text adventure game and a
                    3D marble rolling game, it gave me a great foundation for coding. Basic concepts were easier to relearn when I took my first coding class my senior year of high school. Here I picked up skills
                    in Python. The assignments we were given were my first experiences with difficult coding challenges. By the time I was in college, all my basic skills were solidified, giving me a chance to sharpen them
                    even further in my introductory courses.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px">By the spring of my freshman year, I was fortunate enough to be hired as a student developer at Iowa State.
                    Over the summer, this meant forty hour work weeks of constant challenges, which made for great advancement in my coding ability.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px">More recently, my passion led me to my first hackathon, hosted at Iowa State University. Here I developed my first neural network with a team of two other students.
                    Since then, I've found myself thinking about artificial intelligence and its uses more frequently. In the future, I'd love to work on more AI focused projects.

                    <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px">My favorite personal project is one a team of two students and I did for the 2017 Fall Hackathon at Iowa State. We built a simple game, a genetic algorithm and a
                        neural network in Java in about thirty hours named Myrtl. The program would play the game, at first trying random actions, and then through genetic mutations and neural network modifications, learn how to play
                        the game. It was my first foray into the world of AI and one of the most challenging projects I've ever done. The team and I learned a ton about neural networks, machine learning and AI.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px">I was in charge of the construction of the neural network, which was built by scratch in Java. No libraries were use, which meant I had to have a concrete grasp of the network
                        and what requirements it had to have if I was going to be successful. There were many times in which it was very difficult to conceptualize and visualize the network, but through perseverance I
                        came out successful. I also lent my hand in debugging and tweaking the genetic algorithm, which take several network and selects the best traits to be passed onto a new generation.

                    <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px">The website you're on! This website was built by scratch by me, with a little help from Bootstrap. Using the front-end development skills learned from working at ISU, this is my first
                        website made from the ground up. My HTML and CSS skills could always get better, but I consider this a good example of my front-end capabilities. If a site ever needs to be put up on the fly, or a page could use
                        a look and feel touch up, I know I can hold my own in accomplishing that task.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px">Starting in the spring of 2017, I began working for the Iowa State University IT department as a student software developer. This meant contributing to the development
                            of a web application as a full-stack programmer. I worked alongside full time developers, participating in daily stand-ups centered around the progress of the application. Through this experience I gained valuable
                            teamwork and communication skills.
                        <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px">As a full stack developer, I quickly picked up skills pertaining to all ends of the project. Before being hired, the only language I had real ability in was Java, but by the end of this past summer
                            I had gained skills with JQuery, SQL, HTML and CSS, RESTful API development and the Spring Framework. All this while taking my Java ability to a new level. Learning new things is a major strength of mine and thanks to this
                            experience, my learning confidence has skyrocketed. When given a task using tools I'm not familiar with, I know I can come up with a solution.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px">While working in a team, I learned many useful tools of development. Everybody on the team has a responsibility to review pull requests and projects are done using Agile
                            based values. The specific tools we use for team collaboration include BitBucket, JIRA, Git and Confluence. As a student, I have continued working with the university which allows me to apply what I learn in the classroom to what I do at work. It's a chance to see both the academic
                            and real world uses of coding.

                        <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px"><strong>Java</strong> - My bread and butter. Beginning in my spring semester of freshman year, I've coded with Java almost daily. For the Iowa State University IT Department,
                            I would put in 40 hour work weeks using Java every day within the Spring framework. In class, two of the last three coding courses I've taken have been in Java and the most recent Hackathon project I helped create was
                            done in Java. All this gives me a unique perspective of the academic, industrial and creative power of Java, making me familiar with both its strengths and weaknesses. I'm also very confident I could
                            transition to other similar languages very quickly thanks to my in depth understanding of object-oriented programming.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px"><strong>HTML and CSS</strong> - While my front end development skill has some room for improvement, I'm confident in my abilities to make a good looking website
                            (hopefully this site is proof of that). All my abilities were gained through my experience at ISU IT. I was taught how to design with the user in mind and make everything look visually tied together. Keeping a consistent
                            theme was a must when making pages for a university.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px"><strong>JQuery</strong> - JQuery has been very useful in transferring data between the front-end and the middle-tier of the program. Many of the rules and guidelines are still a bit foreign to me,
                            but with a few Stack Overflow look-ups I'm always able to execute on my plan for how to handle data on a web page. I'm excited to improve my JQuery and Javascript ability in time and am always up to the challenge of using it to
                            accomplish a task.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px"><strong>SQL / Database management</strong> - SQL and general database management are perhaps the weakest parts of my ability as a full stack developer. Most of the data I handled was retrieved using
                            tools in the Spring framework. Even so, I had to manipulate test data many times and learned how exactly to retrieve data for use by the rest of the program.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px"><strong>C</strong> - C was the first language I learned to use in college. I was already familiar with a lot of the concepts taught through C, but many of the projects done in the course pushed what I thought
                            I knew and made me a better programmer overall. Many of these projects were centered around using a DualShock 4 game controller to send data to the computer that would be used by our programs. It was fun making programs
                            that reacted to external controllers and hammered in many of the concepts I thought I knew.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px"><strong>Python</strong> - Python was the first language I became somewhat competent in. I began learning Python my senior year of high school, and while I need to brush up on a lot of the old syntax,
                            I'm sure I could pick it back up quickly. After using Java for so long, I've been wanting to jump back into Python where things are a little less lengthy.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px"><strong>C#</strong> - After hearing that many video games were built in C#, I chose it as my first language to learn my junior year of high school. In retrospect, it was a bit much at the time, and only ever amounted to
                            a text based adventure game. However, after understanding coding the way I do now, I have been looking for opportunities to learn it again. If you're projects demands C#, I'm sure my Java skills would transfer well into C# and I would
                            learn quickly.
                        </p>
