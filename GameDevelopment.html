                        <p class="card-text">Liquid Space is the working title of a space shooter I've been developing for a little over a year. It is a passion project made to
                            capture the fun of old on-rails shooters. While still early in development, I have made great strides in learning Unreal Engine, including
                            the C++ UE4 API, Blueprints, UMG, Materials and the editor itself. It is the game that got me started with game development with and the longest ongoing game
                            development project of mine.
                            Everything you see was assembled by me. Most artistic assets are not my creation, however all systems and code are my own, (with the help of Stack Overflow and tutorials)!

                        <p class="card-text">Eternal Vapor was made with one other teammate as part of Iowa State University's Fall Game Jam. Inspired by the vaporwave artstyle, Eternal Vapor is a platformer about a computer gradually gaining more abilities to assist it in exploring the world of the game.
                            Inspiration comes from Metroidvanias and classic platformers such as Mega Man and Super Mario.
                            My role in this project was gameplay programmer, level designer and 2D asset creator (the header of this page is actually used as a background in the game).
                            The game was made in Unity. Creating this game gave me insight into how to create something that can be played from start to finish, how to design interesting challenges,
                            how to integrate assets into the game and more. My teammate and I were fortunate enough to get an honorable mention for the art-style and unique combination of mechanics.
