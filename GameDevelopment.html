                        <p class="card-text">Liquid Space is the working title of a space shooter I've been developing for a little over a year. It is a passion project made to
                            capture the fun of old on-rails shooters. While still early in development, I have made great strides in learning Unreal Engine, including
                            the C++ UE4 API, Blueprints, UMG, Materials and the editor itself. It is the game that got me started with game development with and the longest ongoing game
                            development project of mine.
                            Everything you see was assembled by me. Most artistic assets are not my creation, however all systems and code are my own (with the help of Stack Overflow and tutorials)!

                        <p class="card-text">CyBot was a project made to learn about behavior trees and incorporating
                            animations with models. The goal is to avoid the 'CyBots', collect the two power-ups, and get
                            to the campanile. The game also has procedurally generated maps using cellular automata. This
                            project helped me understand the design process of making a properly animated and modeled game,
                            and the difficulties of bringing it all together with AI. I'm very happy with how expressive the CyBots are and
                            the atmosphere created with the game. The models were provided by iowa State University, and the enemies are our
                            school's mascot. Mixamo was used for animations.

                        <p class="card-text">This was a project completed for class where we were tasked with implementing the Minimax algorithm to create an AI player than could
                            beat us. Unfortunately, I was unable to find the optimal evaluation function to result in a consistently winning AI, but
                            it was still a great way to learn the algorithm. Aside from the algorithm, I'm proud of the look and feel of the game. I
                            think the UIis straighforward and effective, and the grass in the background give the game a great relaxing feeling.
                            3D models and animations were provided to us by Iowa State University. The grass effect comes from Stylized Forest Lite on
                            the Unity Asset Store.

                        <p class="card-text">Eternal Vapor was made with one other teammate as part of Iowa State University's Fall Game Jam. Inspired by the vaporwave art-style, Eternal Vapor is a platformer about a computer gradually
                            gaining more abilities to assist it in exploring the world of the game.
                            Inspiration comes from Metroidvanias and classic platformers such as Mega Man and Super Mario.
                            My role in this project was gameplay programmer, level designer and 2D asset creator (the header of this page is actually used as a background in the game).
                            The game was made in Unity. Creating this game gave me insight into how to create something that can be played from start to finish, how to design interesting challenges,
                            how to integrate assets into the game and more. My teammate and I were fortunate enough to get an honorable mention for the art-style and unique combination of mechanics.

                            about physics, 3D scenes, and basic game development. The goal of the game is to fly your ship to the
                            UFO mothership with a certain speed. Along the way, you need to avoid asteroids which you can destroy by
                            using a limited supply of torpedoes.

                            including proper visuals, sound effects, score and more. While basic, it's a complete game.
