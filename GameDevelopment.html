        Ever since I was young, I have been playing video games. From Super Mario 64 to Dark Souls to Overwatch, I've been fascinated by everything about them. I love the design,
        the art, the unique stories that can only come from them, and the technology behind them. In fact, video games are what got me into software engineering. As I've become
        a more skilled programmer, I have put my abilities to use in experimenting with gameplay programming. To gain more perspectives and gain inspiration, I am also
        a member of the game development club at Iowa State University where I have competed in a local game jam. Here are a couple projects I am working on or have completed.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph"><strong>Eternal Vapor</strong></p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Eternal Vapor was made with one other teammate as part of Iowa State University's Fall Game Jam. Inspired by the vaporwave artstyle, Eternal Vapor is a platformer about a computer
        gradually gaining more abilities to assist it in exploring the world of the game. Inspiration comes from Metroidvanias and classic platformers such as Mega Man and Super Mario.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">My role in this project was gameplay programmer, level designer and 2D asset creator (the header of this page is actually used as a background in the game). THe game was
        made in Unity. Creating this game gave me insight into how to create something that can be played from start to finish, how to design interesting challenges, how to integrate assets into the game and more. My teammate and
        I were fortunate enough to get an honorable mention for the art-style and unique combination of mechanics.

    <p class="paragraph"><strong>Unreal Engine Space Shooter</strong></p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Inspired by the N64 classic Star Fox 64, this project is a work in progress that attempts to recreate the feeling of playing a classic on rails shooter. This project is also used
        as a way to sharpen my C++ skills and learn about Unreal Engine. The bigggest focus of this project is to make the gameplay as polished as possible. There are a lot of subtleties that
        can be missed when creating such a deceptively simple game, but I aim not to miss any and make a game that feels good to play from the moment you pick up the controller.
