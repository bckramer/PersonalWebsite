            <p class="paragraph"><strong>Java</strong> - Java is the language I have the most experience with. I've used it with John Deere, Iowa State University IT, as well as in many classes.
                It's also been used in one of my personal projects, Myrtle, a neural network that uses genetic algorithms to learn to play a game. When using Java for work, I've had the opportunity
                to sharpen my skills with the Spring Framework as well. Through my professional experience and Myrtle, I've become very confident with my Java capabilities.

            <p class="paragraph"><strong>HTML and CSS</strong> - My HTML and CSS skills were picked up from my time working at Iowa State University, where a lot of the look-and-feel of
                the application I was working on had to be updated. Once I got a good grasp on updating a page, I became responsible for creating my own. This taught me how to make a stylistically
                consistent page using HTML and CSS. I used these skills to create this website, and have since used the site as a way to improve my web development skills further.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph"><strong>JavaScript</strong> - JavaScript is a language that I've mostly used in the form of jQuery at both John Deere and Iowa State University IT. At John Deere,
                I had the opportunity to pair-program with some full-time JavaScript and TypeScript developers, which gave me a good introduction into enterprise JavaScript development. To strengthen my basic
                knowledge, I've implemented JavaScript into this website to manipulate aspects of the HTML and CSS. I'm also taking a course on WebGL, where I'm excited to strengthen my JavaScript
                abilities.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph"><strong>Python</strong> - Python was how I learned the basic concepts of programming all the way back in high school. I didn't jump back into Python
                until sophomore year of college, when I used OpenCV to create an AI that could play computer poker by interpreting what was on the screen and make decisions using a TensorFlow
                neural network. This made me comfortable with Python, and I'm eager to work with it more.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph"><strong>C and C++</strong> - While I don't consider myself a strong C or C++ programmer, I have worked with it enough to understand the concepts. This was
                done in my Advanced Programming Techniques course, where ove the course of the semester we incrementally developed an ASCII dungeon game.
