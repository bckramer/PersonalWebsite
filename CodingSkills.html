            <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px"><strong>Java</strong> - Java is the language I have the most experience with. Beginning in my spring semester of freshman year, I've coded with Java almost daily. For the Iowa State University IT Department,
                I would put in 40 hour work weeks using Java every day within the Spring framework. In class, two of the last three coding courses I've taken have been in Java and the most recent Hackathon project I helped create was
                done in Java. All this gives me a unique perspective of the academic, industrial and creative power of Java, making me familiar with both its strengths and weaknesses. I'm also very confident I could
                transition to other similar languages very quickly thanks to my in depth understanding of object-oriented programming.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px"><strong>HTML and CSS</strong> - While my front-end development skill has some room for improvement, I'm confident in my abilities to make a good looking website, with a little help from Bootstrap
                (hopefully this site is proof of that). All my abilities were gained through my experience working with Iowa State University. I was taught how to design with the user in mind and make everything look visually tied together. Keeping a consistent
                theme was a must when making pages for a university.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px"><strong>JQuery</strong> - JQuery has been very useful in transferring interactions between the front-end and the middle-tier of the program. Many of the rules and guidelines are still a bit foreign to me,
                but with a few Stack Overflow look-ups I'm always able to execute on my plan for how to handle interactions on a web page. My work with JQuery has been done through  I'm excited to improve my JQuery and Javascript ability in time and am always up to the challenge of using it to
                accomplish a task.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px"><strong>SQL / Database management</strong> - SQL and general database management are the weakest parts of my ability as a full stack developer. Most of the data I handled was retrieved using
                tools in the Spring framework. Even so, I had to manipulate test data many times and learned how exactly to retrieve data for use by the rest of the program.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px"><strong>C</strong> - C was the first language I learned to use in college. I was already familiar with a lot of the concepts taught through C, but many of the projects done in the course pushed what I thought
                I knew and made me a better programmer overall. Many of these projects were centered around using a DualShock 4 game controller to send data to the computer that would be used by our programs. It was fun making programs
                that reacted to external controllers and hammered in many of the concepts I thought I knew.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px"><strong>Python</strong> - Python was the first language I became somewhat competent in. I began learning Python my senior year of high school, and while I need to brush up on a lot of the old syntax,
                I'm sure I could pick it back up quickly. After using Java for so long, I've been wanting to jump back into Python where things are a little less lengthy.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px"><strong>C#</strong> - After hearing that many video games were built in C#, I chose it as my first language to learn my junior year of high school. In retrospect, it was a bit much at the time, and only ever amounted to
                a text based adventure game. However, after understanding coding the way I do now, I have been looking for opportunities to learn it again. If you're projects demands C#, I know my Java skills would transfer well into C#.
