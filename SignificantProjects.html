    <p class="paragraph"><strong>Pocket Aces, the Program that Plays Poker</strong></p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Pocket Aces was me and a friend's final project for a graduate course at ISU: HCI 575: Computational Perception. Pocket Aces utilized computer vision to analyze a computer poker program, identifying
        cards, pot sizes, public cards and more. After it had analyzed the screen, it would make a decision after feeding the information into a neural network. The project was done
        entirely in Python using OpenCV and TensorFlow.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        My main task was implementing the computer vision aspect of Pocket Aces, and I'm happy to report that Pocket Aces was highly accurate at identifying the desired information.
        The approach was to use structuring elements to identify areas of interest on the screen, but this method was not always perfect. One of my proudest achievements
        on the project, was developing my own algorithm that, given an image, will identify areas of interest on its own and then dissect the information in the image.
        Below, you can find a link to the GitHub repository for Pocket Aces as well as the final report we wrote which includes results.

    <p class="paragraph"><strong>Myrtl, the Genetic AI</strong></p>
    <p class="paragraph">Myrtle is a project a team of two students and I did for the 2017 Fall Hackathon at Iowa State. We built a simple game, a genetic algorithm and a
        neural network in Java in about thirty hours named Myrtl. The program would play the game, at first trying random actions, and then through genetic mutations and neural network modifications, learn how to play
        the game. It was my first foray into the world of AI and one of the most challenging projects I've ever done. The team and I learned a ton about neural networks, machine learning and AI.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">I was in charge of the construction of the neural network, which was built by scratch in Java. No libraries were use, which meant I had to have a concrete grasp of the network
        and what requirements it had to have if I was going to be successful. There were many times in which it was very difficult to conceptualize and visualize the network, but through perseverance I
        came out successful. I also lent my hand in debugging and tweaking the genetic algorithm, which takes several network and selects the best traits to be passed onto a new generation.

    <p class="paragraph"><strong>My Portfolio Website</strong></p>
    <p class="paragraph">The website you're on! This website was built by scratch by me, with a little help from Bootstrap. Using the front-end development skills learned from working at ISU, this is my first
        website made from the ground up. Thanks to the site, I've become confident in not only my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills, but also my understanding of user experience. I've experimented with severaliterations of the site, trying to make it as welcoming and user friendly as possible on desktop and mobile.</p>
