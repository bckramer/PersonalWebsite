        <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px">My favorite personal project is one a team of two students and I did for the 2017 Fall Hackathon at Iowa State. We built a simple game, a genetic algorithm and a
            neural network in Java in about thirty hours named Myrtl. The program would play the game, at first trying random actions, and then through genetic mutations and neural network modifications, learn how to play
            the game. It was my first foray into the world of AI and one of the most challenging projects I've ever done. The team and I learned a ton about neural networks, machine learning and AI.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px">I was in charge of the construction of the neural network, which was built by scratch in Java. No libraries were use, which meant I had to have a concrete grasp of the network
            and what requirements it had to have if I was going to be successful. There were many times in which it was very difficult to conceptualize and visualize the network, but through perseverance I
            came out successful. I also lent my hand in debugging and tweaking the genetic algorithm, which takes several network and selects the best traits to be passed onto a new generation.

        <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px"><strong>My Portfolio Website</strong></p>
        <p class="paragraph" style="padding: 10px">The website you're on! This website was built by scratch by me, with a little help from Bootstrap. Using the front-end development skills learned from working at ISU, this is my first
            website made from the ground up. My HTML and CSS skills could always get better, but I consider this a good example of my front-end capabilities. If a site ever needs to be put up on the fly, or a page could use
            a look and feel touch up, I know I can hold my own in accomplishing that task.</p>
